 * 0. os sleeping
 * 1. iterrupt happens -  interrupts are disabled
 * 2. os keeps track of interrupted job (bookkeeping)
 * 3. os handles events signaled by interrupts (differs per interrupt)
 * 4. os schedules next job --dispatcher
 * 5. os dispatches job --dispatcher
 * 6. os sleeps
 * 
 * before return to os from each interrupt
 * 	- check if there is room in memory to swap in a new job from drum
 *  - check if jobs ready to run, if so schedule the job
 *  
 *  if a job has outstanding disk i/o requests and no requests are being serviced by disk(job in i/o queue) os can decided to leave 
 *  the job in meory or swap it out to drum but before os inituates an siodisk for any of the jobs i/o requests, the job must be in memory
 *  
 *  bookeeping: 
 *  	- when interrupt happens a running job will be terminated, it is the job of the os to make sure that information about the job that was
 *  	running is not lost
 *  	- must be done at the beginning of each interrupt handler
 *  	- os must schedule a job to run on the cpu before returning to sos
 *  
 *  when job is doing i/o it must be in memeory
